-User Persona:
Employers looking for a computer science stuedent who will appreciate an afinity towards artistic disciplines.

-Information Architecture:
On the header I have a picture, my name and the following text: "Programmer | Designer | Illustrator | Music Composer | Bassist | Game Developer". Although I might have gone a bit too overboard with the self-given titles, the idea is to give readers an idea of who I am without having to read too much text, and hopefully catching their eye.

Next I have an "about me" section, where I explain more in depth who I am and what I can bring to the table. I bring up some of my skills outside of my formal education that are not necesseraly rellevant to any job I may apply to, but the point is to show that I am adaptable and multifaceted.

Following that I have details about my education and skills, winch given my lack of sector-relevant work experience will probably be an important factor for any employer who might be interested in hiring me. My skills are sub-divided in languages, programming languages, design tools and other program proficiencis that I felt aren't as relevant to my area of work, but still worth mentioning just to further re-enforce my multifaceted nature that I hope to imply.

Next I list my provious work expirience as a waiter. Since it's not field-relevant I only hope to imply loyalti (since I have worked there for 4 years).

I then list several portfolios, most of winch are, to be fair, irrelevant. However I provide it as proof that I am not bluffing with my claims. I close providing an email for contact.

-Visual Design:
For this CV I decided not to use flashy colors. I initially went for a minimalist design, but as I messed arround with HTML I ended up using a slightly more colorful palette.

The sections are divided in shades of white. This is a design choice I've seen across many examples of CV, and is meant to improve readability. I chose to have a more eye-catchy but still professional looking header with a blue color gradient, and to footnote the document with a darker blue. It consists of a picture of myself, my name, a list of skills and an interactable content list.

I tried to keep long text paragraphs to a minimum. I wanted to have the "about me" section at the start, because once that's read the rest of the document looks very clean with clear sections and efficient delivery of information.

Each portfoliio and skill set is inside a white frame, winch makes them pop from the rest of the document. Furthermore, the buttons containing links to the portfolios are in a saturated purple-ish blue, winch makes them pop even more and look pressable. The reason I chose so many blue (or at least blue-adjacent) colors is that color makes the document more visually appealing, color consistency makes it look more professional and blue happens to be a common color in professional enviroments.
